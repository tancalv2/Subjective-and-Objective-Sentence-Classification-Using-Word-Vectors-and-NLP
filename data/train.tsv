tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 	1

throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another . 	1

hawn lets it all hang out in this film and i have to admire her guts . sarandon is equally bold and daring in her portrayal of a woman who has lost her way in a closet full of beige suits . 	1
there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 	1
not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 	1
like the best war movies -- and like martial literature going back to the iliad -- it balances the dreadful , unassuageable cruelty of warfare and the valor and decency of those who fight . 	1
the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 	1

two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 	1
poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 	1
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 	1
fontaine indulges her signature style , creating a carefully measured film -- the kind whose impact slowly sneaks up on its audience and haunts them long after leaving the theatre . 	1
his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . 	1
offers a fascinating look into the world of upper-echelon comics . 	1
the heart of the film is the drop dead sexy drea de matteo who , as the mother and real head of the family , commands every scene . 	1
this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 	1
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 	1
as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 	1
imaginative and engaging follow-up , which revolves around a decidedly fresh story line that presents its stars with new challenges , obstacles and emotional opportunities . 	1

broomfield seems to uncover a massive scoop here , revealing the multitude of people involved and the possible motivations behind the killings of his titular subjects . 	1
a belgian gem on the twilight existence of four sisters of a certain age drawn together reluctantly by the need to care for one of their number . 	1

it takes us finally to the comedy clubs that for so many years we saw only at the beginning and end of seinfeld . 	1
by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 	1
it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 	1
this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil	1
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 	1

a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 	1
one of the finest , most humane and important holocaust movies ever made . 	1
has the kitsch appeal of a farm implement on a restaurant wall , or an andy warhol mao poster : interesting , but not for its original purpose . 	1
pan nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic . 	1
the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next . 	1
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 	1
i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 	1
a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama . 	1
the actors are all charged up by their roles , and it rubs off on us : you walk out with a caffeine- and-doughnut high . 	1
a psychological thriller that doesn't really hold up if you think about it too much , but is nonetheless highly entertaining in a low-budget , david lynch-ian way . 	1
got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 	1

it is a timely film and a transporting one . 	1
screenwriter maureen tilyou , director martin duffy and an extremely competent cast handle the controversial aspects of the topic in an even-handed manner . 	1
the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 	1
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 	1
quite funny for the type of movie it is . . . 	1
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 	1
there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 	1
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 	1
thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . 	1
it's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate . 	1
it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 	1
juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 	1

an intelligent and sobering look at a person's self worth , and the measures he or she will take to restore it . 	1
zhang . . . has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast . 	1
in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 	1
you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 	1
 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 	1
the saturation bombing of reggio's images and glass' evocative music . . . ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning . 	1
[smith] simply celebrates the universal desire to fashion our homes for our needs and desires . 	1
the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 	1
one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 	1
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 	1
gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 	1
a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love . 	1
one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then . 	1
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 	1
a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 	1
robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 	1
those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 	1

"it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its "" dead wife communicating from beyond the grave "" framework is even remotely new or interesting . "	1
a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '	1
it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 	1
the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 	1
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 	1
if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 	1
 . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 	1
often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 	1
this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 	1
"my little eye is the best little "" horror "" movie i've seen in years . "	1
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 	1
the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 	1
on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 	1
it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 	1
if you're able to go , relax and lower your expectations , you might be carried away by it . 	1
french director helene angel's dark but deftly handled fable about familial violence has a terrifying , fairy-tale atmosphere that's in perfect keeping with its unique point of view . 	1
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 	1
as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 	1
about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 	1
a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 	1
adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 	1
it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 	1
this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters . 	1
for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale . 	1
despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film . 	1
not a bad way to spend a couple of hours . 	1
in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 	1
the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose . 	1
douglas mcgrath's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically . 	1
it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 	1
kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 	1
caso voc� sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do t�rmino da proje��o , n�o se preocupe : ningu�m lhe enviar� penas simbolizando covardia . 	1
� uma pena que , mais tarde , o pr�prio filme abandone o tom de par�dia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clich�s que havia satirizado . 	1
what should have been an entertaining cinematic souvenir solely for wilco fans ended up becoming a smart , involving , and occasionally infuriating film	1
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 	1
lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 	1
a hilarious film for anyone who remembers lying as a kid -- and anyone who wants to see a movie that's just plain fun . 	1
as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 	1
thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda . 	1
harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 	1
the sound of ma's cello alone is reason not to miss naqoyqatsi . 	1
full of unforgiving irony and quiet realism , a song for martin stands as a powerful and moving achievement . 	1
it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 	1
an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years . 	1
the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 	1
the kind of movie that seduces you into becoming putty in its manipulative card-sharking hands and making you enjoy being taken in by its shameless contrivance . 	1
she may not be real , but the laughs are . 	1
there's . . . tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 	1
rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 	1
none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 	1
angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale . 	1
"if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , "" rollerball "" 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . "	1
offers a gentle summer fantasy for both grown-ups and little ones . 	1
one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years . 	1
it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 	1
one hour photo offers a very interesting snapshot of some decidedly modern pathologies -- suburban alienation and the illusions generated by the advent of the photographic image . 	1
every single scene conveys a significant and concise narrative development , yet does so in an unassuming , patient fashion that emphasizes detail . 	1
watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 	1
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 	1
part travelogue , part road picture , part meditation on class , mortality and intimacy , this extraordinary little movie might be the perfect harbinger of summer , as astute as it is steamy . 	1
while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 	1
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 	1
no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 	1
a beautiful meditation on the life force and redemptive power of literature -- for writers and readers alike -- and on what it means to be fully alive , navigating the rocky terrain between vision and execution . 	1
scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 	1
scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 	1
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 	1
an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 	1
the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 	1
the film's saving grace is the brilliant execution of its march numbers . 	1
it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 	1
the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 	1
although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless �70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 	1
birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honor� ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 	1
the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama	1
a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature . 	1
"from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , "" besotted "" is misbegotten"	1
this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 	1
director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy . 	1
none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 	1
while peterson and her ageless alter ego keep an ironic detachment from the melodramatics , there's no irony in the end-title dedication to price -- it obviously comes straight from the heart . 	1
 . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 	1
its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 	1
it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 	1
a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love . 	1
4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip . 	1
stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 	1
jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 	1
so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed . 	1
the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 	1
a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 	1
cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 	1
by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . 	1
the film isn't especially dynamic , but it brims with insightful , poignant memories from survivors . 	1
it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 	1
beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 	1
this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 	1
though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 	1
the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 	1
r xmas offers a poetic and profane ambiguity that's vintage ferrara . 	1
adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book . 	1
the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 	1
a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 	1
the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 	1
with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path . 	1
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 	1
there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 	1
you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 	1
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 	1
it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 	1
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 	1
the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 	1
food for love endeavors and largely succeeds in lending equal weight to the emotional turmoil of its older and younger characters . 	1
though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 	1
just like his characters , writer-director alfonso cuar&oacute ; n . . . takes the road less traveled . 	1
it recycles every clich� about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 	1
" "" the ring "" is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . "	1
beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 	1
 . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 	1
aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 	1
its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 	1
cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche . 	1
a surprisingly good-natured throwback to the '80s heyday of the body-switching genre . 	1
the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann . 	1

a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 	1
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 	1

just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 	1
the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between , and it works . 	1
the footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with suge knight are just two of the elements that will grab you . 	1
a picture as charmingly insubstantial as the world it invokes . 	1
it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi . 	1

a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 	1
by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 	1
much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 	1
it is psychedelic , hypnotic , exhilarating and horrifying , and sometimes all at once . 	1

overall , this is a juicy movie but certainly not a trashy one . 	1
its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 	1

morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 	1
the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 	1
it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 	1
skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor . 	1

you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you'll laugh . 	1
the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 	1
twists are so bizarre , and the story so worth documenting , that it's easy to forget this film's shortcomings . 	1
it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness . 	1
family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 	1
a shrewd and splendidly volatile b movie structured around a highly original gambit of suspense . 	1
the perfect vehicle for berling and bouquet , and both are superb . 	1
a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 	1
a gracefully acted , unsentimental , quite likable little coming-of-age movie . 	1

passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . . 	1
las horas es una de las obras que con mayor apasionamiento reflexiona acerca del hecho de vivir . . . 	1

shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life . 	1
 . . . a rousing fantasy of bloodless revolution against capricious colonial rulers . 	1
at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 	1
really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 	1
this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 	1
it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 	1
about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . 	1
the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 	1

after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clich� has been unturned . but no . 	1
an immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music . 	1
the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 	1
while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 	1

the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 	1
paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 	1
worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change . 	1
the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game . 	1
now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 	1
the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 	1
don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . 	1
whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 	1
cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera . 	1
this spawn of william shakespeare and ray kroc has more fun with [the] thin premise than you might expect , mostly because of maura tierney . 	1
