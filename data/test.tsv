if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 	1
imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 	1
the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 	1
it's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original . 	1
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 	1
it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 	1
although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey	1
upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 	1
unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 	1
what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 	1
the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 	1
the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 	1

strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 	1
swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 	1
we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 	1
it's simply delightful to watch an actor like michel serrault do his stuff . 	1
"while "" real women have curves "" suffers from an obvious and simplistic screenplay , it's a bright looking , well-acted charmer . "	1

as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 	1
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 	1
the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 	1
the process of figuring out the moment the movie re-imagines the battle of the bulge with a bare-chested guardsman and a pike is more than worth the price of admission . 	1
add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 	1

worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 	1
a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 	1
an excellent date movie , because you and your date will likely be clinging on to each other within 10 minutes . 	1
playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 	1

a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch . 	1
it is really quite ironic then that the one guy putting out consistently good comedy is hollywood's most serious actor . 	1
a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . . 	1
it's gripping entertainment in a popular vein -- the police procedural -- that nevertheless follows no preconceived formulas . 	1
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 	1
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 	1
schefberg has the courage to make the story messily un-formulaic . 	1
poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 	1
the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 	1

spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 	1
an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 	1
the film is probably worth seeing for the sheer spectacle of it all , for the sake of obtaining valuable information , and for finding more closure on a story that has always been missing several pieces . 	1
laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 	1
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 	1
like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 	1
the film is like sitting in a downtown caf� , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 	1
a self-narrated , blatantly lop-sided , cocky , nonchalant , fascinating and juicily entertaining documentary . 	1
for all its bile and incoherence , in praise of love is filled with haunting images and insights . godard may be a lion in winter , but the lion still roars . 	1
hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 	1
casting its gaze on painting masterworks and thousands of jewel-encrusted , elaborately costumed extras , russian ark is like nothing you've ever seen . 	1
while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 	1
in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 	1
if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 	1
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 	1
waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 	1
as charming , humorous and heimisch as its nomadic subjects . 	1
 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 	1
hoffman's unfettered performance beautifully captures wilson's sad , manic quality . 	1
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 	1
maybe the title should have been confusions of a dangerous mind , though the confusion , in this case , can be pretty sublime . 	1
what would have otherwise been a routine nostalgic coming-of-ager takes on a new , innovative form . 	1
it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline . 	1
10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 	1
 . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 	1
schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 	1
the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 	1
it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 	1
the movie is the strangest experience : a matter-of-fact thing that swallows you whole . 	1
the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 	1
tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 	1
sort of an existential version of a seinfeld episode . 	1
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 	1
" "" 13 conversations about one thing "" is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling . "	1
a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 	1
it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times . 	1
the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 	1
the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 	1
all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . 	1
[nesbitt's is] one of those performances that simply 'is . '	1
for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 	1
whaley's performance is earnest and often riveting , but he should have taken a few lessons from his peers at amateur night . 	1
a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 	1
like the hugely successful first film , the sequel provides pleasant , engaging if largely disposable entertainment for the general audience . 	1
no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 	1
if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 	1
initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 	1
never again doesn't quite rise above the conventions it attempts to deconstruct , but at its center are two gifted actors who are more than willing to take chances . 	1
davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort . 	1
there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 	1
sunshine state is sayles at his most robert altman-ish , purposefully juggling about a dozen narrative balls in the air , and letting the mundanity and smallish drama of everyday life tell a larger story . 	1
the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 	1
nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 	1
a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . 	1
a delectable little treat that's sunny , funny , and far more intelligent than you'd expect . 	1
�passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 	1
a sparkling cosmopolitan comedy that plays fast and loose with sacred cows of family values . 	1
everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships . 	1
it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 	1
"acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes "" never again "" worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice"	1
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 	1
pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 	1
after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . 	1
[koshashvili] sometimes drags [the ideas] out ( the film needs tightening ) , but they're worth considering all the same . 	1
a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 	1
obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 	1
the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 	1
 . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 	1
divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 	1
from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 	1
in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 	1
